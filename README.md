**Performance Analysis of Next-Gen Multiple Access Schemes for 6G & Beyond**

This repository contains MATLAB implementations and simulation scripts for evaluating next-generation multiple access schemes for 6G and beyond. 
The project focuses on analyzing the performance of various multiple access techniques including OFDMA, Power-Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA), and Code-Domain NOMA (CD-NOMA) under realistic conditions. 
Detailed simulations incorporate multi-path fading effects and dynamic user scenarios to assess bit error rate (BER), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), throughput, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

**_1) BER vs. SNR Analysis:_**
Evaluated BER variations in Power-Domain NOMA as the number of users increases, providing insights into system performance under varying SNR conditions.

**_2) Impact of Multi-Path Fading:_**
Incorporated multi-path fading effects to analyze its impact on both BER and throughput for OFDMA and PD-NOMA techniques.

**_3) Comparative Efficiency Study:_**
Conducted a comparative study of spectral efficiency and realistic energy efficiency (without a fixed power budget) across OFDMA, PD-NOMA, and CD-NOMA, enabling a holistic understanding of their performance trade-offs.
